# Quantum-3SAT-Solver
This project proposes a new algorithm to solve 3-SAT problem by utilizing quantum properties and classic random walk approach. This documentation will help you to try different setups yourself.

# Requirements
Python version 3.7.1  
Qiskit version 0.19.1 

# How to try it yourself

You need to create the CNF you want the algorithm to solve in generate_lines file. Then you can change the variables in run_experiment file to your interest or recreate our results.
